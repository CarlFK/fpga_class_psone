- Colorlight i5
- Support board
- Computer with Ethernet and USB and admin access with OSS-CAD installed

## Boards

They will be given to you at the session or before if you want to start playing with it (don't break it!)

## Computer setup

You need a few things installed on your computer:

- OSS-CAD
- Yosys
- A text editor you love and trust and are comfortable with

And you need to be able to setup your own networks (so no work locked computers) and install software from the internet (so no parental lock or other insanities)

### Linux
### MacOS
### Windows
Poor you, this is probably the most complicated OS to use for all of that.
