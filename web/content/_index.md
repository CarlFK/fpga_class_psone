# PS1's 2023 FPGA 101

Welcome to our class website.

You will find all the code, and the source of the website at:
https://github.com/bjonnh/fpga_class_psone/

There is a menu on the left, on a phone you may have to click on the three lines icon.

You'll probably want to start with the [Introduction](./introduction/)

The [Candy jar](candyjar) contains more detailled pages about the subjects discussed in the class.

There are checkmarks next to the pages you visited. You can clear them on the bottom left of the page.

You can change the theme of the website on the bottom left next to the brush. It is not guaranteed to look right if you use a light theme.
