## Aims of the class
Teach the basics of FPGA programming using Open Source and Free Software. You will not be an expert in FPGAs but you should be able to create simple programs and build more complex things over time.
This is not a class about learning how to use a computer or learning the deep intricacies of Verilog and LUTs. This is a practical class where you get your hands dirty trying to make your board do cool things. And we will sparkle a little bit of theory so you get a sense of what is happening.

## Organization
You need to come with a computer already setup with all the tools. See the [Requirements](../requirements/)
## Disclaimer
We are not responsible for any damage, anywhere and on anything. You are connecting electronic devices to your computer and this comes with risks that you need to evaluate for yourself. Make sure you have backups and that you don't use a computer that you can't replace.

You are also going to install quite a lot of software from various places, so make sure you are using appropriate protections against the threats you fear the most.
