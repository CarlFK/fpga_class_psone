## Aims of the class
Teach the basics of FPGA programming using Open Source and Free Software. You will not be an expert in FPGAs but you should be able to create simple programs and build more complex things over time.
This is not a class about learning how to use a computer or learning the deep intricacies of Verilog and LUTs. This is a practical class where you get your hands dirty trying to make your board do cool things. And we will sparkle a little bit of theory so you get a sense of what is happening.

## Organization

The class will happen on May, 27th 2023 at PS1 and start promptly at 11AM, you can come a bit earlier if you think you need more time to setup.

So we will have a tiny formal introduction but we will jump really quickly into the practical work directly on your boards and you will learn things as you do.

The second part of the day will be about you hacking things together with the electronic components we have in the electronics area or the ones you or others did bring.

And the last part will be about you showing the group what you've achieved.
