- Colorlight i5
- Support board
- Computer with Ethernet and USB and admin access with OSS-CAD installed

## Boards

They will be given to you at the session or before if you want to start playing with it (don't break it!)

## Computer setup

You need a few things installed on your computer BEFORE THE CLASS:

- OSS-CAD and Yosys (you have instructions on the next pages for Linux, MacOS and Windows)
- A text editor you love and trust and are comfortable with
- git clone https://github.com/bjonnh/fpga_class_psone/ (update with git pull the day of the class)

And you need to be able to setup your own networks (so no work-locked computers) and install software from the internet (so no parental lock or other insanities).

Make sure you don't try it for the first time on the day of the class, you will be unhappy and we will be as well.
