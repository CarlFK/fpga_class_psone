- Colorlight i5
- Support board
- Computer with Ethernet and USB and admin access with OSS-CAD installed

## Boards

They will be given to you at the session or before if you want to start playing with it (don't break it!)

## Computer setup

You need a few things installed on your computer BEFORE THE CLASS:

- OSS-CAD
- Yosys
- A text editor you love and trust and are comfortable with

And you need to be able to setup your own networks (so no work locked computers) and install software from the internet (so no parental lock or other insanities).

Make sure you don't try it for the first time on the day of the class, you will be unhappy and we will be as well.


### VM using VirtualBox
What we highly recommend for Windows and Mac users is to install a Ubuntu virtual machine, follow the Linux instructions and share the USB device with the VM.

We may be distributing a VM image that has everything preinstalled if we have time to go throught it.

Go to the settings of the VM, Ports, USB and add the device JTAG device.
