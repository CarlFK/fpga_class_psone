You need a computer with Wifi, an available USB port and you need to be admin on that computer. 

You will have to install things a couple days BEFORE the class so we can help you solve issues.

## Computer setup

You need a few things installed on your computer BEFORE THE CLASS:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- OSS-CAD and Yosys (you have instructions on the next pages for [Linux](./linux), [MacOS](./macos) and [Windows](./windows))
- A text editor you love and trust and are comfortable with
- Either download the zip of the course files on [Github](https://github.com/bjonnh/fpga_class_psone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or run `git clone https://github.com/bjonnh/fpga_class_psone/` (re-download it or update with `git pull` the day of the class)

You need to be able to connect to a Wifi network and install software from the internet (so no parental lock or other insanities).

Make sure you don't try it for the first time on the day of the class, you will be unhappy and we will be as well.

## Boards

You will receive three boards (the first two are stacked together):
- A colorlight i5, the FPGA board itself on a SODIMM support
- A breakout/carrier board which holds the SODIMM and in turn provides HDMI, a USB programmer and tons of IOs on PMOD-like connectors
- A double ethernet PMOD that will provide connectivity (we will connect that to PS1's network) 

All these items will be given to you at the beginning of the session or before if you want to start playing with it (don't break them!)
